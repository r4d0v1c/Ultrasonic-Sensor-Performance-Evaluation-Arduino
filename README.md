#  Ultrasonic Sensor Performance Evaluation (Arduino Uno)

##  Project Overview

This project presents an experimental evaluation of the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor connected to an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The focus is on measuring the sensor’s performance in terms of accuracy, response time, and stability across various distances and environmental conditions.

The goal is to provide a quantitative analysis of the sensor's behavior through collected data, visualized results, and statistical insights.

##  Objectives

-  Measure the sensor's accuracy at different distances  
-  Evaluate response time and latency  
-  Analyze measurement consistency and variability (e.g., standard deviation)  
-  Visualize data through plots and statistical summaries  
-  Document methodology and findings in a structured way
