# 🧪 Ultrasonic Sensor Performance Evaluation (Arduino Uno)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents an experimental evaluation of the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor connected to an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The focus is on measuring the sensor’s performance in terms of accuracy, response time, and stability across various distances and environmental conditions.

The goal is to provide a quantitative analysis of the sensor's behavior through collected data, visualized results, and statistical insights.
